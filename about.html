      <p class="sectionContent"> The creation of this short film was done purely by me as a mashup of multiple ideas that had been thought up. I came up with these ideas after doing research on a vast number of other short films although unlike them i was going to take a more direct approach instead of the abstract thinking used by many others. The genre was decided on as it was the best to be able to effectively convey emotion while not being over bearing. It was still a massive challenge as the entire thing was done solo and so not meeting deadlines created serious setbacks until production and publishing was complete. I took the most insporation from psychological horror games such as omori where everything seems fine and fun at the start but later on you realise something is deeply wrong but the film takes the tragic parts of it and less the full idea of horror but still incorporating the terror and disbelief at what has happend in the story. The time constraints put in place for the animation itself i drastically underestimated the time taken to be able to complete it, also the fact i had just had surgery during the production time didn't help.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="sectionContent">need to add shots of the animation and me working on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
