    <p>My first animated film that i have created i drastically underrestimated the amount of time that would have to be sunk into to fully complete but i have also learned the basics of animation including key and transition frames which has lead to a realisation why i never went further with frame by frame animation and that is because i heavily dislike how it looks unless done in a 3d software where i am only moving the limbs of different models therefore making them easier to come up with realistic movement and also it is much less time restrictive if we are not counting textures. If given the choice next project i will not be optionally doing film work anymore as ive realised its simply not a passion of mine although it was still a project i found interesting to dive into for the time that i had to spend time on it, just next time i will focus n chosing something far less time intensive so that won't panic when i've also got work and other life events that get in te way of projects.</p>
    <p>The story follows a young man moving away from his home and heading off to uni but comes back later to realise something is amiss at his old family home. A tragic story sculpted to tug on heart strings, animated and written by Icarus Studios(me).</p>
    <p>need to add the short animated film here after adding it to youtube</p>
